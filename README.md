# Brand-Activism_Twitter-Handles-
This repository entails two r-scrips. One which gathers tweets from companies twitter accounts. 
These companies engage in Brand Activism and are taken from three different lists (COREBRAND BRAND POWER US 2020 & INTERBRAND GLOBAL US 2021 & KANTAR BRAND FOOTP FMCG US 2020)
The other script tests how to pull retweets from conversation IDs. It only does so with a test list of three conv_ids to see if it works. 
To scale it up use full list of needed Conv_ids.
